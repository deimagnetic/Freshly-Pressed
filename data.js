Seems reasonable, but I’m usually trying to spot if they have one of my least favorite albums of his: <em>Bob Dylan’s Greatest Hits</em>. Problem is, I already own it. Three times. If they have a copy, I quickly open its dusty side pocket to see if I’m bringing another one home with me. I can’t help myself.</p>\n<p>In 1967, when Columbia Records released the album each copy was accompanied by a beautiful poster designed by <strong>Milton Glaser</strong>. It’s rare to see one still slipped inside an old copy, but when it happens I bring it home. I really love this poster and have looked at it a lot. Two full sized copies are framed in my living room, next to each other. When people come over, we refer to it as our Double Dylans. Mr. Glaser was kind enough to talk to me on the phone and answer a few questions about it all.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rightearleft.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/martin_dupuis_glaser_poster_1-1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1171\" src=\"https://rightearleft.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/martin_dupuis_glaser_poster_1-1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=717\" alt=\"Martin_Dupuis_Glaser_Poster_1.1\"   /></a></p>\n<p><strong>I’ve heard that the aesthetic of the Babyteeth typeface you used in the Dylan poster emerged from        a sign you saw in Mexico. What attracted you to this sign and how did it influence the tone and personality of the other letters you made?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Milton Glaser:</strong> I saw this strange sign and was intrigued by the sort of innocence of the <strong>E</strong> and the fact that if you knew anything about typography you would never do a thing like that, the funny little staircase. There were a couple of other letters that also were primitive and simple in their reduction of letter forms and they sort of gave me a clue to a way to do a simple minded flat typeface.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rightearleft.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/martin-dupuis_glazer_2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1106\" src=\"https://rightearleft.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/martin-dupuis_glazer_2.jpg?w=480&#038;h=420\" alt=\"Martin Dupuis_Glazer_2\"   /></a></p>\n<p><strong>So, the naive element of how unreadable it was attracted you? </strong></p>\n<p>Actually it&#8217;s the opposite. It’s how readable it was even though it deviated from our understanding of what an <strong>E</strong> is supposed to be. I’m always interested in the nature of perception and how much you understand from limited information. That issue of being able to understand what you’re looking at has always been such throughout my work. I’m interested not so much in its peculiarity but in its recognition.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rightearleft.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/martin-dupuis_glazer_5.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-1122\" src=\"https://rightearleft.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/martin-dupuis_glazer_5.jpg?w=858&#038;h=641\" alt=\"Martin Dupuis_Glazer_5\" width=\"858\" height=\"641\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Was Babyteeth specifically made for the Dylan poster, or was it something you were working on before and had around?</strong></p>\n<p>That was just an accident. I kind of had it on my desk at the same time. And I said if I have to use the word Dylan I’ll use this typeface largely because there wasn’t anything that looked quite like that around and I wanted to make the word itself look peculiar.</p>\n<p><strong>You’ve stated that the best work of an artist or designer emerges from unifying separate occurrences. Can you talk about the separate occurrences that came together to help shape the Dylan poster?</strong></p>\n<p>My idea is that you link things that are unrelated; it’s ninety percent of the imaginative content of what you do. The interesting thing is that firstly everything is connected, and secondly &#8211; once you find the connection it seems inevitable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rightearleft.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/martin-dupuis_glazer_4.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1108\" src=\"https://rightearleft.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/martin-dupuis_glazer_4.jpg?w=480&#038;h=494\" alt=\"Martin Dupuis_Glazer_4\"   /></a></p>\n<p>The Dylan piece is directly derivative from the self-portrait out of cut paper that Duchamp did. I saw it for the first time and was astonished at the amount of energy and power it had from a simple black silhouette. No technology that was impressive or anything – it was just this black profile in the corner of a piece of paper and I said Jesus! look at the energy that that releases. And it was just in my mind and I thought, I could do that with Dylan.</p>\n<p>Than I thought that it was too austere and too easily understood and I was also interested in Islamic painting and so I said I’ll take a little piece of this decorative Islamic idea and combine it with a very unlikely self portrait by Duchamp and see what comes out for Bob Dylan. And that’s what I meant earlier &#8211; that connecting seemingly unrelated events is one of the essential tools of artists.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rightearleft.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/martin-dupuis_glazer_6.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-1133\" src=\"https://rightearleft.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/martin-dupuis_glazer_6.jpg?w=986&#038;h=1001\" alt=\"Martin Dupuis_Glazer_6\" width=\"986\" height=\"1001\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>I haven’t checked the dates, but were you around when he was in NY? </strong></p>\n<p>He was around. In fact Duchamp quite coincidentally had a studio on 14<sup>th</sup> street next to mine. I rented a little room to paint in and Duchamp was right down the hall. I never had a long conversation with him outside of <em>do you have the keys to the bathroom</em> but he spent all his time playing chess by mail. And he never did any artwork during that period. This was late in his life.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rightearleft.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/martin-dupuis_glazer_8.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-1144\" src=\"https://rightearleft.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/martin-dupuis_glazer_8.jpg?w=980&#038;h=1302\" alt=\"Martin Dupuis_Glazer_8\" width=\"980\" height=\"1302\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>His readymades greatly puzzle me, I’ve always had a hard time getting my head around it all.<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>It’s hard to talk about an understanding of them for they are meant to be confusing, transgressive and provocative. Above all what they don&#8217;t want to be is explained in a literal way. You have to understand that at a certain point the logic involved in explaining a piece of art collapses, because you can&#8217;t explain art through logic.</p>\n<p>Art occupies another part of the brain, it doesn&#8217;t affect your neurology in the same way. And all attempts to be analytical about this stuff turns out to be nonsense, or a good part of it is. So you have to respect the unconscious function and the profound mystery of art making without trying to analyze every gesture and thought because mostly that’s bullshit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rightearleft.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/martin-dupuis_glazer_11.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-1150\" src=\"https://rightearleft.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/martin-dupuis_glazer_11.jpg?w=916&#038;h=906\" alt=\"Martin Dupuis_Glazer_11\" width=\"916\" height=\"906\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>The iconography of Dylan seems like a dream canvas to be molding and commenting upon, what did he mean to you then and what does he mean to you now?</strong></p>\n<p>I liked Dylan very much. I knew him. He was represented by Albert Grossman, who is a good friend of mine. And I would see him occasionally, actually I haven’t seen him since I did that poster which is a very long time ago. He was just one of the true poets and artists around who’s work moved you in a way that went beyond entertainment.</p>\n<p><strong>The poster you did was for a greatest hits album, so I imagine he was already big and that the mythology of Dylan was already in place when you did this work.</strong></p>\n<p>It was. He was very famous and he hated the album that was produced, which was the last album he did for Columbia. They did all the editing and assembly of that album. He had nothing to do with it and he had already broken his contract. So he tended to hate everything in it, and although he’s never told me that he never liked the poster, in fact we’ve never discussed it at all – it will probably remain the most iconic representation because its been reproduced so many times.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rightearleft.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/martin-dupuis_glazer_31.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1111\" src=\"https://rightearleft.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/martin-dupuis_glazer_31.jpg?w=480&#038;h=702\" alt=\"Martin Dupuis_Glazer_3\"   /></a></p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;ve seen a rough version of the Dylan image that has a different silhouette and a harmonica, did the project go through many different phases?</strong></p>\n<p>No, the silhouette is the same but in the original I had a harmonica. It was the art director who said you know maybe you can take out the harmonica and he was right. And actually this was the only solution I arrived at, which happens very frequently.</p>\n<p><strong>There is a great sense of exploring contrasts in the poster: the black and white silhouette vs. the blast of color in the hair, the organic shapes in the image vs. the geometric rigidity of the type – do you see the exploration of dualities as an element that finds itself in your your body of work or did it spawn out of a personal reflection from Dylan’s music and mythology?</strong></p>\n<p>No I think it&#8217;s like most stuff, it&#8217;s highly intuitive. You are trying to make something that will change people’s perception without exactly knowing how to do it except through a certain response to form making. You know, the mystery of how an artist with three strokes can make something that moves the mind as opposed to artists that never move the mind is beyond anyone’s understanding.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rightearleft.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/martin-dupuis_glazer_12.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-1152\" src=\"https://rightearleft.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/martin-dupuis_glazer_12.jpg?w=952&#038;h=686\" alt=\"Martin Dupuis_Glazer_12\" width=\"952\" height=\"686\" /></a>I went to the Matisse show a couple of weeks ago and I looked at these colored scraps of paper and I thought why are they so profound and why do we respond to them the way we do … why is this museum full of thousands of people who want to experience these little cut paper pieces. You don&#8217;t get there. There is no way to explain it except that there is some unique understanding that the artist have of what moves people. And not everybody has it, and in fact its one of the distinctions between artists and professionals. It’s that most of the work you see is not art because it does not achieve that consequence and does not make you feel that your life has been changed by the experience.</p>\n",

The sun is on the rise somewhere in the east, but the light hasn’t yet reached this place. In the distance a small dog barks sharp, rhythmically, and steady. A siren wails and fades. All else is quiet, all except for the strange noise emanating from an outbuilding behind the main house. It’s a cacophonous noise. Unexpected. So you creep up closer. Tiptoeing now like a trespasser, a voyeur into the past. You shouldn’t be here at all. Yet in this lucid dream you press your ear against the locked door and listen, straining to catch the strands of a voice. <i>The</i> voice. His voice. Perhaps you’re hoping that he might be playing a guitar, jamming with his band. But instead you hear unexpected but familiar noise. You hear the sound of a different kind of playing. It’s the squeaking of shoes on hardwood, the <i>pop</i> and <i>twang</i> of a blue rubber ball rocketing off simulated catgut, followed by the resonant <i>crack</i> of it against a wall; and a different sort of music, that telltale <i>pop</i> and <i>pong</i> ringing out as the ball smacks off the back glass. You linger a while, listening to the high-pitched <i>slap</i> of a well-hit shot, and a short volley of forehand smashes going off like firecrackers. <i>Boom, boom, boom</i>. And laughter. Lots of laughter. Because Elvis Presley, the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll is playing racquetball. And the King loves racquetball. You know this game but not this side of Elvis, not this part of the story. This is your game, your father’s game, a game of noise and speed. And more than anything you wish you could push the door open on that night and join the play.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">* * *</p>\n<p>Early that August morning, just hours before he died, Elvis Aaron Presley played his last game of racquetball. Wracked with insomnia once again he’d summoned his friends for a game. He’d asked for his favorite racquet, Red Guitar (named such because of the red guitar silhouette painted on the strings); and he asked his best friend, cousin Billy Smith and Billy’s wife to join him and his girlfriend, Ginger for a game.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to say for sure what exactly drew Elvis to the court that fateful night or what drew him to the game in the first place. Perhaps like me in my late thirties and early forties when I took up the game again, Elvis was seeking an escape. I like to think he too craved the <i>smash</i> and <i>slam</i> of a simple blue ball, and the way it lets you forget the sludge of life. It <i>is</i> addictive. This leaving. This racquet play. This sideways step into music and sport. Because when the game is good like a hit song, the court takes all the competing noise of the world, all the pressures and pain, and it absorbs them, shatters them and drowns them out in a cleansing blue noise. Every game is a dither, a rattle to your gauges.</p>\n<p>Maybe Elvis appreciated such shaking, or maybe he just wanted a good laugh or a good rush before he died. Maybe he just figured all that exercise would help him sleep finally. Elvis had taken up the game after his wife Priscilla left him for her Tae Kwon Do instructor. My own therapist suggested that I take up some regular exercise to help with anxiety and depression. Racquetball, she assured me, would make me happier; and I have to admit that she may have been on to something.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the reasons behind Elvis’s final request, it was hard to say no to the King, even at such an ungodly hour. His friends indulged him in a few games and afterward lounged around in the adjacent piano bar for a while. Elvis is said to have sang the last two songs of his life at this piano. Most experts seem to agree that those songs were &#8220;Unchained Melody&#8221; and &#8220;Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain.” After he finished, Elvis said goodnight to his friends. Feeling tired, he showered and changed out of his workout clothes, choosing a pair of comfortable pajamas. He crawled into bed next to Ginger and sat up reading a book titled <i>A Scientific Search for the Face of Jesus</i> by Frank O Adams.</p>\n<p>When Ginger rolled over in bed a while later and cracked an eye, reaching a hand out to Elvis, he was still awake, still reading the Adams book. He told her he was going to the bathroom. Then Elvis got up, the book still clutched in his hand, and Ginger went back to sleep. She would never see Elvis alive again. They found the book on the floor of the bathroom next to his body.</p>\n<p>Elvis died reading on the toilet—or at least he died very near the toilet. But according to most sources he died not from the 14 different drugs found in his system but from a fatal arrhythmia, a heart attack; and when I’ve told people that Elvis played racquetball just a short time before he died, many have wondered if racquetball killed Elvis. They wondered if the activity was too much for his addled heart. Mostly I think his death sounds so normal, so ordinary in many ways. He died of a heart attack while reading on the toilet. It could happen to any one of us.</p>\n<p>Perhaps Elvis <i>was</i> taken down by the rhythm of racquetball, by a messed up beat or thump or bang in his heart brought on by the noisy ruckus of the game, or by the physical exertion of chasing that blue ball around the court. But I don’t know about any of that, don’t know the medical probabilities and don’t really care. I don’t care if racquetball killed Elvis. Because I’m pretty sure the game also let him live a little longer and a little fuller, if only for a couple of hours.</p>\n<p>[pullquote align=&#8221;center&#8221;]Racquetball, she assured me, would make me happier; and I have to admit that she may have been on to something.[/pullquote]</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">* * *</p>\n<p>By most accounts, Elvis wasn’t terribly good at racquetball. This did not, however, stop him from having his own court built at Graceland shortly after learning the game from the son of his trusted physician, Dr. Nick (George Nichopoulos), a figure just as controversial in many ways as Michael Jackson’s notorious drug-dispensing doctor. But in addition to feeding him a steady diet of prescription narcotics, Dr. Nick was also, paradoxically, someone who’d been able to get Elvis to exercise.</p>\n<p>Just as he was contributing to Elvis’s decline he was also undoubtedly prolonging his life. You can’t help getting exercise when you play racquetball, and it’s so fun you hardly notice. The game, even played somewhat halfheartedly, is an incredible workout, combining both cardiovascular and strength training; and probably thanks in large part to Dr. Nick’s prescribed activity, Elvis lost over 20 pounds and may have staved off all-out organ failure for at least a few months near the end of his life. If others are right about the ameliorative effects of regular exercise, it seems clear that the game probably also made the King a little happier.</p>\n<p>Racquetball was also social for Elvis, something he shared with his most trusted friends, his posse of family and others known to many as the Memphis Mafia. Along with a love of fireworks and booze, guns, and nice cars, the group also apparently bonded over an appreciation for racquetball. Though the stories seem apocryphal, The King and his crew apparently played regularly around Memphis in the late &#8217;70s. Stories tell of the whole gang showing up en masse at a racquetball club for some fun, followed shortly thereafter by a crush of nearly hysterical fans; and at least part of Elvis’s desire to build his own court at Graceland was due to the public spectacle he and the Mafia caused at such racquetball outings.</p>\n<p>Elvis was also said to harbor dreams of building racquetball complexes across the country; and though the Elvis Presley Racquetball and Swim Club, the King’s Courts, or any other Elvis-inspired fitness center that I can dream up never actually materialized, the vision of private, urban, “everyman’s” fitness centers was a dream that would eventually come to fruition in many ways, much of it centered around music city, Memphis, Tennessee, where until 2010, the U.S. National Racquetball championships were held for fourteen consecutive years.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">* * *</p>\n<p>The truth is I’m more interested in Elvis’s interest in racquetball than I am in the sensational details of his death. I want to take a scalpel to all the details of the Elvis legend that don’t matter so much to me. I want to cut away his troubled personal life, his rocky relationship with Priscilla and other women, or his rumored impotence and paranoia at the end, even his supposed tiff with his girlfriend, Ginger on the night he died. I can appreciate the stories of him giving away Cadillacs and playing with fireworks, but I have to admit that I’m only mildly interested in his music, appreciative of the early work and the occasional sing-along to “Viva Las Vegas” on a road trip. But I want to ignore the long list of drugs in his system when he died. I don’t care whether he died on the toilet or next to the toilet or in front of the toilet, or whether his pajama pants were down or not, in part because I find such discussions humiliating and rather pointless, but also because in death we are all humiliated. Metaphorically speaking, every death is an intimate experience and many of us die with our pants down, vulnerable, face first on the floor in front of the toilet. Hopefully we’re reading better books than Elvis.</p>\n<p>What I really care about is Elvis’s decision, just hours before his death, to play racquetball, a game that I love for many reasons, a game I can’t stop thinking about. This means something, I’m sure. This small slice of shared experience. This common space between us, a racquetball court, was the last place Elvis played and, thus, perhaps the last place he was truly alive in his body. Or at least that’s what I like to believe. Though it’s often overlooked, a side note to the more the salacious stories of that evening—such as Elvis going out at midnight for a dentist appointment, wearing a DEA jumpsuit, downing pre-packaged baggies of pills—the King’s choice to play racquetball with his friends intrigues me more than just about any other detail of his life or death.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">* * *</p>\n<p>Much like rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll, racquetball is a hybrid invention created and marketed in the &#8217;50s in the United States by a few visionary individuals. Though he didn’t give it its current name, Joe Sobek in Greenwich, Connecticut is widely credited as the inventor and marketer of the game as we know it. Sobek’s goal was to create a faster, easier sport that combined elements of both handball and squash. Handball was hard on the body and squash was hard to master. Racquetball, a uniquely American amalgam of the two, became an instant hit in the YMCA where Sobek worked and at JCC’s (Jewish Community Centers) and other urban gyms across the country.</p>\n<p>Racquetball and squash, though related, have very different personalities. In squash there are rules about where on the wall you can hit a shot, what walls you have to hit first, and what walls you can’t hit first. My dad, who had taken up squash later in life, tried to explain the rules to me once and I became as confused as I did when he tried to teach me how to play cribbage.</p>\n<p>Racquetball is different. The rules are easy to master because there are relatively few of them. In racquetball every wall is in play. Everything’s fair game. More significantly, however, is the existence in racquetball of the “kill shot.” This shot is the ultimate expression of power and skill. The “kill shot” is an un-returnable shot that hits low on the wall, sometimes right at the crack where wall meets floor, and then dribbles out, impossible to return, effectively “killing” the ball’s momentum and the opponents chances. Racquetball racquets are rated according to their “kill shot power,” and much of the game strategy is focused on setting oneself up for the shot.</p>\n<p>In squash there is no kill shot. They are forbidden by the rules of the game. This difference alone defines much of the difference between the two games. To put it in other terms, squash is a strategic dance, a game of finesse and strength, like a waltz competition with a partner. Racquetball is more like competitive slam dancing to speed metal with your opponent. It’s a game that emphasizes individualism, power and force, speed and aggression. The sport is as quintessentially American as rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll, apple pie, monster trucks . . . and Elvis.</p>\n<p>[pullquote align=&#8221;center&#8221;]It’s a game that emphasizes individualism, power and force, speed and aggression. The sport is as quintessentially American as rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll, apple pie, monster trucks . . . and Elvis.[/pullquote]</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">* * *</p>\n<p>Elvis played racquetball with his friends, but it’s not clear if his posse really enjoyed the game or just enjoyed being around Elvis. Sport, even causally enjoyed amongst friends can be a test, a tug at the bonds that define your relationship and your identity. We’ve all had those experiences where fun suddenly turns competitive, where one guy takes a game too seriously and the whole dynamic shifts. That guy was usually me.</p>\n<p>Elvis was 42 when he started playing the game in the wake of a separation and divorce. I was in my early 40’s when I started playing racquetball again, perhaps as a kind of escape or therapeutic response to my own issues. I played in spurts of activity when I had the time or when I could find someone who would play with me. I wasn’t far from being the crafty old guy at the gym. I have bad knees, at least one messed up shoulder, and I’m Sasquatch-slow. But if there’s a positive, it’s that I’m blessed with simian-like arms and a decent understanding of how that frantic blue ball bounces and moves through space.</p>\n<p>I’ve also come to understand the importance of patience. In racquetball, you have to let the ball come to you. You have to watch the ball and not crowd it. You can’t impose your will upon the ball because it will not bounce to your wishes. You can spend all game chasing that thing into corners and it will always move faster than you, always bounce in ways you can’t predict.</p>\n<p>If we’re to trust the stories, Elvis’s final game of racquetball wasn’t the display of physical artistry I like to imagine, but instead quickly deteriorated into a free-for-all game of dodgeball where Elvis hit balls at his friends and girlfriend, Ginger, laughing at their discomfort like some kind of bully. It’s possible tempers flared and a racket or two was thrown.</p>\n<p>This troubles me. It suggests to me that the game didn’t mean to Elvis what I want it to mean, that racquetball was just something to do, something to help him sleep, or worse a way for him to feel powerful again. Fans and biographers seem, however, to worry more over what songs he sung at the piano bar or what he said to Billy or Ginger or anyone else that night; or they worry about the list of drugs he ingested, the clothes he wore, the book he was reading. Few people seem to worry as much about the King and his racquetball court, this temple of noise and energy, and how he played his last game. Part of me wants to rescue the King from that image of a bully or buffoon on the court. I want to believe he was better than the stories.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">* * *</p>\n<p>Now imagine this possibility: It’s late at night and the moon is so fat it might croak. You’re back again at the Graceland of your imagination. Listening. Trespassing in the past because such journeys are relatively easy for you, perhaps because up to this point you’ve engaged with Elvis mostly as a pop-culture construct, a caricature only amplified by the other sensation details of the night he died; and because such constructs are malleable as clay, you know you can shape them into your own solipsistic idea, can make them better or at least make them your own in some way. So let’s pretend it’s maybe a day or two before the King kicks the bucket, well outside the penumbra of the spotlight on August 16. Elvis is up again, unable to sleep, and he’s playing to relax and playing for fun. Perhaps this time you’ve found your way inside the court. Perhaps you’ve moved beyond the glass that separates the two of you. Elvis swings at a bouncing blue ball. He’s wearing a white tracksuit with yellow piping and blue stripes stretching down the sleeves and legs. He’s wearing a headband and swinging his Red Guitar racquet. He’s laughing at you in your baggy shorts and your wristbands. You’re playing racquetball with the King, if only for a serve or two.</p>\n<p>Though it’s hard for him to hit them with any regularity, Elvis clearly appreciates the focus and precision of a kill shot, hit low to the floor, and the music and geometry of the long, looping shots that strike high and pinball around the upper walls. Sometimes when he can’t get to a shot to return it, he’ll just watch the ball bounce, tracking it like a bird-dog, listening to the sound of it. This is something the two of you can share, this appreciation for the noise and movement of the game.</p>\n<p>Elvis smiles a lot when he’s on the court, clearly soothed by the <i>squeak</i>, <i>squeak </i>lullaby of shoes on the hardwood, a <i>slam</i> of soles, even the visceral <i>grunts</i> and <i>barks</i>, the hip <i>crashes</i> against the walls. You can see that Elvis loves the noise of the game just like you do, loves the <i>bwong-snap</i> of a forehand smash, the artillery-like racket of sound, and that special trick of physics that lets you hear the ball hit the wall a split second after you see it.</p>\n<p>He’s big enough to seem like a bully but that’s not how Elvis carries himself in his court, not on this night. You don’t want to infantilize him but there is something distinctly childlike and unselfconscious about Elvis in this space. He’s playing, really playing, and perhaps he enjoys your failures a bit too much. Perhaps he laughs when you swing and miss. Maybe he tries to hit you with the ball a couple of times just for kicks. But he’s jamming right along, making some noise with you. He’s not great and wouldn’t have lasted long in a real game with your dad or even with you if you were playing hard; and part of you wants to give him some tips, to teach Elvis a couple of things about the game. You want to talk about patience and focus. You want to talk about discipline and kill shots. You want to save him through the game. And still he’s out there, alive and running around, swinging his Red Guitar and having fun. You can hear his shoes squeaking on the wood. You can hear it all, especially the way the acoustics of the court seem to rescue his voice from the excesses of his life; it booms deep and resonant and new again, and you think you could listen to him play all night long.</p>\n<p>[pullquote align=&#8221;center&#8221;]He’s wearing a headband and swinging his Red Guitar racquet. He’s laughing at you in your baggy shorts and your wristbands. You’re playing racquetball with the King, if only for a serve or two.[/pullquote]</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">* * *</p>\n<p>I don’t want to believe that racquetball matters to his legacy simply because it was the King’s last game, just something he did, and important only because it preceded the last songs he sang.</p>\n<p>For the sake of argument let’s suppose that in the hours before he died, Elvis choose to play hard and play fair, to compete and try to win, or at least to enjoy a good jam session on the court amongst friends. Let&#8217;s assume he chose to surrender some part of himself to the game of racquetball, to let go of his inhibitions and really just play; and let’s imagine that Elvis was at least capable of hitting the ball really hard, if not equally capable of a decent serve. Even if that last game didn’t work out perfectly, does such an image of Elvis change the story of that night? Does his last game, however it was played, make the King’s last breath more or less tragic?</p>\n<p>I don’t know. But I do know that for me this fact, his choice, makes the story of that night much more interesting, much deeper and more complicated. The simple fact—Elvis played racquetball shortly before he died—somehow makes him less of a caricature, less pop culture construct, and more real, more honest and human. The choice to play is perhaps more noble and humble than at first it seems, and more complicated than many other choices Elvis made that night. The choice to play is a choice to survive, to thrive and feel the noise of the game.</p>\n<p>Though I’ve never visited Graceland and must admit to not feeling a great desire to do so, I would like to see the racquetball court—or what’s left of it. Apparently the King’s court was long ago converted into a museum display of his gold and platinum records. You can’t rent a racquet and ball and hit some shots on the King’s Court. But I suppose a display case could be considered a fitting use for the space. In my imagination it <i>is</i> a kind of temple to the playful creative King, to the inventive, imaginative, and improvisational Elvis, and I like to think I could stand there, surrounded by his records, and hear the ghost noise of his last game still echoing off the walls.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">* * *</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>From the book </i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Ultrasonic-Steven-Church/dp/1935084704?tag=longreads-20\"><i>Ultrasonic: Essays</i></a><i>, by Steven Church.</i></p>\n",

			"content": "<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 5\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>My mother’s first husband, who was the first mentally ill person I ever met, rents storage spaces all over D.C. He saves in crate after carton after crate: paper towel tubes, his son’s second grade science projects and college term papers, broken air conditioners, hammers, screwdrivers, curtain rods, weights, spatulas, pots and pans, old cans of paint, drills, sandwich bags, magazines and books and paper clips, window panes and big, long rolls of pink insulation and leather gloves and half-empty cans of shoe polish and arm chairs and tube tops and baby aspirin and vinyl records as well as the files of the court records (as well as their Xeroxes) of what was said before the judge between he and my mother more than forty years ago. When I saw him a couple of years ago, he was standing in my sister’s dining room organizing boxes of National Geographic, which he’d bought an estate sale and had now given to my sister and her husband. My sister was cooking dinner while talking on the cordless and thereby (and very cleverly) not paying any attention to him. He said I looked like my mother and that he’d always loved my mother no matter that the marriage didn’t work out and that my grandmother had always liked him and that she was such a beautiful thing, my mother, and wasn’t I the sister that said some awful thing to him on the telephone? Because who was I to tell him what kind of father to be? What was I? Crazy?</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 6\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Maybe so, I thought, though I couldn’t remember anything I’d ever said to him on the phone.</p>\n<p>What I did remember was the day my sister said she wasn’t coming home to live with him. She was sixteen at the time—full-grown, to my mind, and old enough. Her stories were that he wouldn’t let her go anywhere, kept a washing machine unplugged in the middle of his kitchen, ranted about her grades and her weight and her friends and their parents, and made her and his wife and very young son tie stakes in the yard every four inches so as to sow in a more orderly fashion the grass seed that never did get sown. They were standing in the hallway upstairs in my parents’ house and my mother was pacing, smoking cigarettes one right after the next and saying that no, she wasn’t going to send Lynn back this time, Lynn was going to stay with us. I remember watching the story develop from the doorframe of my room. I almost remember the desire to make popcorn, because it was better than any movie you could name. I mean, it was better than any boy-fight at school and beat the hippies singing and my parents’ late-night laughing and <em>Laugh-In</em> and bra-burning and <em>Ms</em>. magazine. Maybe my urge to spy originated in this precise moment of real-life human drama: this stand-off between my mother and father and her weird-assed first husband, with the girl/woman between them all like contraband. Because you have to admit it’s interesting .</p>\n<p>Only nobody had a gun. My father’s an art historian, painter, and the youngest brother of three sisters and so he wouldn’t even know how to spell HUNT for the spelling bee that he would under no circumstances attend, but if he had owned a gun, during this moment he would have been polishing it or cleaning it or loading it, because that’s how tense things were—the whole hallway was like a drum or canvas or a fitted cotton sheet with four hearts smoking in the center. I can’t remember the exact words any person spoke, but I do remember getting the distinct impression that taboos were being broken. Black Panthers were frenching the Daughters of the American Revolution in that hallway—people were kissing zebras, were slicing their own tongues with razor blades and sodomizing vacuum cleaners. They were stringing themselves up to the light fixtures with embroidery thread and singing Christmas carols, were making flower arrangements with copper pipes and steering automobiles with their feet and wearing strapless dresses into Canadian snowstorms and serving white wine with roast beef. This is because, it suddenly occurs to me, that you can distinguish the crazy from the merely eccentric in this additional way: with crazy people you end up making a lot more concessions—you say X likes Y and so I guess he’s going to get it, because to tell you the God’s honest truth I can’t take another moment right now of the ranting and the raving and the weeping and the pouting and the drinking and the screaming. People in association with lunatics seem more often than not to give the lunatics what they want—they lie and capitulate and accede and relent until they really don’t mind watching baseball twelve hours a day, as they tell their friends on the telephone—they like digging in the backyard by moonlight and sleeping in a bed with coupons and magazines and Barbie doll legs.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 7\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>My mother was not married to my sister’s father for very long—she had already left him by the time she was nineteen—and does not in any case choose to talk about him. Once by way of an excuse she told me that living with him gave her a headache that put her in the hospital, and now I think of this headache—which the doctors could neither diagnose nor cure nor dull with morphine—as my mother’s will rising up to save her—my mother’s will stomping its size eight Southern foot on the brain’s tiny blood vessels in order to get her attention so she’d finally assemble the courage to pack her bags and her Nova and her little baby girl and drive back home to Virginia where she would live a much better life than the one she’d started, by accident and mistake and mislaid longing, to live with my sister’s father. And here it was happening again in the long wallpapered hallway where I watched on gleefully from my antique doorframe: my mother’s will was rising like cream, like spring, like stormy ocean waves, and given the size of it— given how very ample her no was—all you could say was that it was a beautiful sight, indeed. Because the daughter would not be coming home, Mister-man, and you could scream and weep and threaten lawyers and courtrooms and murder all the live long day for all Mama cared, because Mama did not.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 8\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Once out of what is apparently a compulsion to study mental illness I took a group of students (all women, as I was teaching at the time at an all-women’s college) to eat lunch at a local homeless shelter. I suppose they thought I was offering them an experience they would not choose for themselves so as to help them see the world for what it really was. I suppose I told whatever supervisors I would have had—the department chair or the dean—that I was trying to encourage my writers to give what they could to their communities—to serve others, you know, and care (to use the far-too-empty expression) about the less fortunate. But because I don’t really believe we can buy ourselves the least bit into the heaven that I do not believe in or appreciate the piousness that too often leads people to donate their used coats to the poor, I’m certain my real motives were far less charitable.</p>\n<p>After the sixteen of us walked though what can only be described as the lounge of the shelter (our shoulders slumped, our heads lowered) the director asked my students to sit down at long, light-brown fold-out tables. They were to each choose a seat between the men already gathered there. And so, one at a time, the young women sat, looking up at me every few minutes from their too-open eyes as one man said motherfucker and another drew circles on his arm with a steak knife and another touched a young woman’s red hair with his finger or his fork. The men smelled like vinegar and rotten olives; two or three bare light bulbs flickered from the simple fixture in the ceiling; the room was hushed, as though someone was about to pray.</p>\n<p>Surely this isn’t so, the girls’ eyes said to me. Surely this isn’t true.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 9\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>I remember I leaned against the doorframe (always the doorframe) of that meager, meager kitchen and watched my students pick at their food and stiffen and fuss lightly with their hair and stick a finger or two between their bracelets and their wrists. I remember I crossed my arms; maybe I took a sip of the sweet tea that one of the homeless men had given me and maybe I just held it there in the dim, yellow light while I waited for the beat to return to my heart. Maybe I nodded it’s true, it’s true, and maybe I didn’t. If I didn’t, I’m sorry.</p>\n<p>Because it is true: we are mad, it is true. And spies as well, through and through.</p>\n<p>&#8212;</p>\n<p><em>copyright 2015 Adrian Blevins</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

			"content": "<p>When I was an undergrad, one of my reasons for wanting to continue in academia was my aversion to Western formal clothing. If I became a Ph.D. student and then a professor, I thought, I would hardly ever need to wear suits or dress shirts, and such a life appealed to me. I had seen academics of all stripes dress in all sorts of ways, and I naively believed that this signalled something very progressive about academia&#8217;s stance towards appearance: wear what you want, because you&#8217;ll be evaluated based upon your ideas and work, not how you choose to present yourself.</p>\n<p>But a <a href=\"http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2015_03_02/caredit.a1500054\">recent article</a> in a column called <em>Ask Alice (</em>published on the website of Science, one of the most high profile scientific journals out there) confirms my naivete. In this piece, an anonymous academic who finds themselves in a &#8220;conservative place&#8221; for their postdoc, asks Dr. Alice Huang, &#8220;Am I crazy to think that no one here can see beyond my [tattoos and piercings]?&#8221; In her response, Dr. Huang suggests that this postdoc should not &#8220;jeopardize your career at this early stage with gratuitous self-expression.&#8221; Instead, &#8220;remove the nose ring and hide your other decorations under a long-sleeved black turtleneck and jeans&#8221; while at the workplace, because &#8220;body decorations and piercings become a distraction and may indicate, to some, immaturity or vanity.&#8221; Wow.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t you think, Dr. Huang, you&#8217;d be able to assess whether I&#8217;m immature or vain by actually talking to me? Do you think the few hours I&#8217;ve spent over the last fifteen years getting my tattoos or piercings is time I should have spent furthering my career? And do you honestly think I need to dress like Steve Jobs before anyone takes me seriously?</p>\n<p>What this piece suggests to me and other young academics is that we can dress how we want, as long as we stay carefully within the lines of what is permissible according to the academic establishment. But consider that the academic establishment has, for the longest time, been overwhelmingly male, white, straight, and upper class. What this establishment considers acceptable is heavily coloured by its history of exclusivity. If you&#8217;re at all invested in making academia more welcoming of diversity, then you have to recognize that diversity in class or gender or race or sexual orientation comes hand in hand with diversity of self-expression. This means that instead of telling young academics to censor themselves until they&#8217;ve received tenure, we should be asking academics within the establishment to not judge their colleagues based on their body art, or clothing, or hair style, or any other part of their appearance. Is that such an outrageous thought?</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m always amused when people suggest that tattoos or piercings are a sign of impulsive rebelliousness—I spent more time deciding whether or not to get my first tattoo than I spent deciding where to go to grad school (rest assured, Dr. Huang, I didn&#8217;t ponder the tattoo question during work hours). Personally, my tattoos represent feelings and ideas that are important to me, and reflect times of my life that I want to remember. My mother designed one of my tattoos for me. In one of the seven piercings on my ears, I wear a earring that my grandmother had made for me from the diamonds she wore for most of her adult life and that she gave to me before she died. You can see this body art, and decide that my self expression is gratuitous, or you can accept that different people share their identities with the world in different ways, and welcome this diversity of thought into the scientific establishment. Academia is already home to plenty of pierced and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2011/11/07/science/20111107-tattoos.html\">tattooed scientists</a>—you might as well get used to us.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_978\" style=\"width: 490px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://ambikamath.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/img_4086.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-978\" src=\"https://ambikamath.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/img_4086.jpg?w=480&#038;h=360\" alt=\"My first tattoo: an antlion larvae, my first study organism. \"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">My first tattoo: an antlion larvae, my first study organism.</p></div>\n",

There were carpets on the walls. An entire seat just for me. And not the usual rubbish designed for children, made of Marmite-proof, Oros-repellent plastic: this one was upholstered in the kind of plush, red velvet you can only dream of when you&#8217;re six. Best of all, we&#8217;d come to see <em>Chariots Of Fire</em>, a film about two of my favourite things at the time: chariots and fire.</p>\n<p>When we opened on a beach in Scotland, with no sign of burning two-wheelers, I was disappointed. But only for a moment. Soon I was bewitched by the iconic theme, clean as endorphins pulsing through a brain; hypnotised by the white-clad figures skipping through the St Andrews surf.</p>\n<p>One of them seemed to be overcome with some sort of rapture, throwing back his head and sprinting ahead. This was Eric Liddell, the Scottish missionary who ran for God first and Great Britain second. Running, it seemed, was not just beautiful and poetic. It was spiritual.</p>\n<p>Ten years later, on a wind-scoured field in Cape Town, I remembered Liddell and his animal delight in running fast and far. Like Liddell, I was wearing white running togs and was surrounded by swift young men.I, too, had thrown my head back. But this wasn&#8217;t Scotland and I wasn&#8217;t Liddell. This was physical education and my head was thrown back because I was close to death and fighting for breath. Also, I knew that if I looked down I would begin to vomit and not stop until I had heaved up all my internal organs.</p>\n<p>Some of my classmates might have been filled with the Holy Spirit, but I was filled with an unholy rage: the burning in my lungs and legs was nothing compared to the fiery loathing I felt for my gym teacher.</p>\n<p>His instructions had been clear and stupid. We would have to run around the field a certain number of times in under a certain number of minutes (I want to say it was 6000 times in under two minutes, but I might be misremembering). If anyone failed, everyone would have to do it again.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Had nobody understood the underlying message of Forrest Gump?</em></h3>\n<p>Now he stood there, stopwatch in his paw, yapping at me out of his meaty face like a sock puppet stuffed with raw mincemeat. Next to him stood the gazelles who had finished in under the stipulated time, squeaking at me to run faster so that they didn&#8217;t have to do it all again and maybe break a sweat this time. God, how I hated them. How I hated <em>Chariots of Fire</em> with its lies about the joys of running and its ridiculous absence of burning chariots. How I hated this world in which runners are admired and walkers &#8211; sensible, civilised, non-vomiting walkers &#8211; are shouted at. Had nobody understood the underlying message of <em>Forrest Gump</em>? Had nobody realised that if you run often and for no reason, you will end up being shot in the buttocks, your childhood sweetheart will lie to you and die, and your momma will be Sally Field?</p>\n<p>I have not run since that day. Now and then I have scuttled. I have been known to skedaddle. Once, when threatened, I high-tailed it. But I do not run. And this has given me the space and tranquility to understand that running is not only unnatural and hateful, but that it&#8217;s not even a thing. It&#8217;s really just an endlessly deferred fall onto your face.</p>\n<p>This is usually the part where runners object angrily, their resting heart rate surging to around 20 beats a minute, and point out that humans owe much of their success to running. They explain that we are one of the few species that can sweat while we run; that our ancestors simply ran their overheated prey to a standstill.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t dispute the history. But I ask you: did those brave ancestors run so that we would have to keep running? No. They ran so that we wouldn&#8217;t have to. They pounded across the plains and reduced their feet to calloused nubbins so that you and I could walk to our kitchen and put a non-perishable food-like substance into our mouths. To run is to spit in the sweaty, pain-etched faces of our forebears, and I for one refuse to be so disrespectful.</p>\n<p>Thank you, ancient hunter.I honour you, and I chew open this carton of custard to celebrate the race you ran for all of us.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p><em>First published in The Times and <a href=\"http://www.timeslive.co.za/thetimes/2015/04/08/the-big-read-my-first-four-minute-bile\" target=\"_blank\">TimesLive</a></em></p>\n",

			"content": "<p>When Kendrick Lamar released his sophomore album, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/to-pimp-a-butterfly/id974187289\"><em>To Pimp A Butterfly</em> (2015)</a>, I was in the middle of teaching a unit on Toni Morrison&#8217;s novel, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Bluest-Eye-Vintage-International/dp/0307278441\"><em>The Bluest Eye</em> (1970)</a>. My freshmen students were grappling with some big ideas and some really complex language. Framing the unit as an &#8220;Anti-Oppression&#8221; study, we took special efforts to define and explore the kinds of institutional and internalized racism that manifest in the lives of Morrison&#8217;s African-American characters, particularly the 11-year-old Pecola Breedlove and her mother, Pauline. We posed questions about oppression and the media &#8211; and after looking at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_and_Jane\">Dick &amp; Jane primers</a> that serve as precursors to each chapter, considered the influence of a <a href=\"http://feministteacher.com/2010/04/13/exposing-the-master-narrative-teaching-toni-morrisons-the-bluest-eye/\">&#8220;master narrative&#8221;</a> that always privileges whiteness.</p>\n<p>Set in the 1940s, the Breedlove family lives in poverty. Their only escape is the silver screen, a place where they idolize the glamorous stars of the film industry. Given the historical context of the novel, we can assume these actors are white. On the rare occasion that a person of color was cast in a feature film during this time period, they would surely occupy a subservient role &#8211; perhaps a butler or maid. So what happens when the collective voice of society perpetuates whiteness as the standard? What happens when children never see themselves as the superhero? the boss? the damsel in distress? the star? The master narrative tells us that white is good, pure, and clean. Perhaps most destructive of all though, it says white is beautiful.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bemoons.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/1035x1035-f1efb3f4-9a6d-4f78-8ca8-594ab646d198-bestsizeavailable.jpeg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-199 alignleft\" src=\"https://bemoons.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/1035x1035-f1efb3f4-9a6d-4f78-8ca8-594ab646d198-bestsizeavailable.jpeg?w=300&#038;h=300\" alt=\"1035x1035-f1efb3f4-9a6d-4f78-8ca8-594ab646d198-bestSizeAvailable\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>Butterflies are beautiful, too &#8211; and they are full of color. Butterflies are so beautiful, they can&#8217;t be made any more so. They can&#8217;t be manipulated, exploited, controlled, or confined. So why does America keep trying to do these same things to people of color? Why does America keep trying to pimp the butterfly? Surely we must know by now, the <a href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/civil-rights-movement\">Civil Rights Movement</a> was a metamorphoses from which we emerged into a colorblind, post-racial springtime, shedding the cocoon of <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/\">Jim Crow</a>, right?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s 2015 and Kendrick Lamar doesn&#8217;t think so. His album continues the conversation that Toni Morrison started in 1970. Inspired by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_is_beautiful\">Black Is Beautiful cultural movement</a> of the previous decade, Morrison offers a devastating critique of white supremacy. <em>The Bluest Eye</em> is arguably one of the most powerful novels about racism ever written. It critiques the media&#8217;s obsession with stars like <a href=\"http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131130195653/disney/images/d/d4/Shirley-temple-ca-1936-everett.jpg\">Shirley Temple</a> and <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Garbo_in_Inspiration.jpg\">Greta Garbo</a>, revealing the psycho-social madness that results when a little girl becomes the victim of oppression directed inwards. She prays for blue eyes &#8211; her only wish &#8211; thinking it will make her beautiful. Why wouldn&#8217;t she? Morrison reminds us this message is everywhere, including &#8220;shops, magazines, newspapers, window signs,&#8221; and that, &#8220;all the world had agreed a blue-eyed, yellow-haired, pink-skinned doll was what every girl child treasured&#8221; (Morrison 19).</p>\n<p>Pecola Breedlove is the butterfly, still being pimped in 2015, and behind decades of mass incarceration, urban renewal, white flight, and gentrification, she&#8217;s now a middle-aged woman, hoping for change, hoping for springtime. Luckily, she has a soundtrack in <em>TPAB</em>.</p>\n<p>While it&#8217;s problematic to cast Kendrick as a savior for hip hop and black America, it&#8217;s equally as dangerous to dismiss him. He offers a new brand of hope for <a href=\"http://bakarikitwana.com/books/hip-hop-generation\">the hip hop generation</a> &#8211; one that is rooted in traditions of resistance and struggle. With pain and anger in his voice on <a href=\"http://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-the-blacker-the-berry-lyrics\">&#8220;The Blacker the Berry,&#8221;</a> Kendrick describes weeping, &#8220;when <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Trayvon_Martin\">Trayvon Martin</a> was in the street.&#8221; It&#8217;s easy to become devastated by the stagnation of race relations in America. But Kendrick is careful to balance the chaos with a clear and purposeful sense of direction &#8211; even when shining the light on his own hypocr<img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-201\" src=\"https://bemoons.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/img_1840.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"IMG_1840\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" />itical double consciousness. So how do we help our students find hope amidst such chaos and contradiction?</p>\n<p>My freshmen students were devastated when Pecola was raped and impregnated by her own father. Many school districts ban the novel for the graphic images depicting this scene. However, I&#8217;m willing to feel uncomfortable with my students if it means we can reimagine alternative realities for Pecola.</p>\n<p>What would have happened if Pecola listened to <a href=\"http://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-i-lyrics\">Kendrick&#8217;s hit single, &#8220;i&#8221;</a> which celebrates, &#8220;I love myself&#8221; in a world that tells black people not to? Would the outcome of the story, Pecola&#8217;s schizophrenic break with reality, have played out differently if she heard Rapsody&#8217;s stand-out verse on <a href=\"http://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-complexion-a-zulu-love-lyrics\">&#8220;Complexion (A Zulu Love),&#8221;</a> where she raps about self-love. I&#8217;m not arguing that music could have prevented Pecola&#8217;s rape, or that we should assign blame to people who don&#8217;t know how to love themselves, but maybe Pecola&#8217;s blackness could have taken on new meaning and new beauty if she had influences like Kendrick or Rapsody. Perhaps she could have responded more critically to the cacophony of oppressive voices that enforce the master narrative and lead to internalized oppression for too many people. Morrison writes that the marigolds didn&#8217;t grow that spring. Nothing grew. The soil of that land was polluted, corrupted. It&#8217;s likely there were no butterflies that year.</p>\n<p>When I asked my freshmen students if they saw any hope in the novel, their response was somewhat problematic. Most saw none. And I don&#8217;t blame them. The language is beautiful, but the narrative is bleak, dark, and depressing. But it&#8217;s what we <em>do</em> with our critical reading of the text that matters. It&#8217;s the honest conversations, reflections, and revised understandings that extend our reading onto the world around us. That&#8217;s where the promise of hope lives. One of my students, in a commentary response on my class blog, articulated this idea in a powerful way for all of us:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">The novel represents hope because it is somebody taking notice and writing about all this oppression and racism. It brings attention to these serious problems and when people are aware, action follows. Even though Pecola’s story ends sadly, more hope is represented in Claudia [the narrator], for she does not totally succumb to the oppression. She pulls apart the [white baby] doll, questioning why it is so beautiful, [and] she has the strength to&#8230;pray for Pecola when Pecola is pregnant, planting the marigolds to help, and not judging like the rest of the town.</p>\n<p>This is the kind of extended thinking that we want to illicit from our students. As <a href=\"https://graduate.lclark.edu/live/profiles/220-linda-christensen\">Linda Christensen</a> says, we want to teach for joy and justice, finding the hope in our critical readings and extending those understandings to the world around us. When I think about critical media literacy and Paulo Freire, I think about my students looking twice at an advertisement on their newsfeed &#8211; asking themselves questions like these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who made this image?</li>\n<li>Who is the intended audience?</li>\n<li>What is their agenda?</li>\n<li>Who does this image include? Who does it not include?</li>\n<li>Who has the power in this image? Who doesn&#8217;t?</li>\n<li>What beliefs, values, or ideologies does this image promote?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our 21st century students are great consumers. They are saturated with information, media, and layers of subtext. If we don&#8217;t ask them to critique different kinds of media, to &#8220;read&#8221; the world through a critical lens, we aren&#8217;t teaching literacy at all. They must become producers of new knowledge and new understandings, new texts and new meanings.</p>\n<p>If I pedagogically ignored Kendrick&#8217;s album release at a time when my students were reading Toni Morrison alongside articles about Mike Brown, Ferguson, <a href=\"http://blacklivesmatter.com/\">#BlackLivesMatter </a>&#8211; and considering the disposability of black bodies in an America that constructs a standard of beauty based solely on whiteness &#8211; I would have missed an opportunity to engage them in a pivotal conversation about race, hope, and justice. I would have missed an opportunity to speak to their hip-hop sensibilities &#8211; their hip-hop ways of being and knowing. I would have missed a chance to develop a set of profound connections to a popular culture text that is part of their lives. So here&#8217;s the first thing I did:</p>\n<p>As students concluded their reading of the novel, I assigned a <a href=\"https://mooneyclassblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/wl_black_lives_matter_project1.docx\">&#8220;Critical Lens Essay&#8221; </a>that asks them to &#8220;look deeply at the text, think for yourself, and consider the kinds of oppression that are experienced by the characters in Morrison’s novel.&#8221; My initial essay prompt looked like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What kinds of oppression do black people experience when the collective voice of society tells them they must adhere to white standards of beauty?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After listening to <em>Pimp A Butterfly and </em>noticing connections to the unit in every song, we studied some of the tracks, (which I&#8217;ll discuss later) and I created a second, optional prompt to choose from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How is the influence of the “Black Is Beautiful” cultural movement of the 1960s visible in both Toni Morrison’s novel, <em>The Bluest Eye</em> (1970) and Kendrick Lamar’s album <em>To Pimp A Butterfly</em> (2015)? Consider how both authors comment on how oppression manifests itself as internalized racism.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More than half my students opted for the second prompt, even though it requires more work. They must quote from both Morrison&#8217;s novel and Kendrick&#8217;s album as evidence &#8211; and discuss that evidence at length, demonstrating how it proves a carefully constructed thesis statement. I made a pedagogical decision to provide the <a href=\"https://mooneyclassblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/to-pimp-a-butterfly-lyrics-clean1.docx\">&#8220;edited&#8221; or &#8220;clean&#8221; lyrics to a select group of songs on the album</a> and I even posted a link to the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/to-pimp-a-butterfly/id976974313\">&#8220;edited&#8221; version on iTunes</a>. I know most students have access to the &#8220;explicit&#8221; version, and I would have no objections if they quote from these versions, but since these students are freshmen, some of whom might have parents that object to profanity, even when it&#8217;s being used for a noble, just, and artistic cause, I decided to give them access to a version without profanity. I find it problematic to call an album like this, &#8220;dirty.&#8221; Often times, with some of my older students, and in my after-school &#8220;Hip-Hop Lit&#8221; extracurricular class, I use the unedited versions of songs to maintain their artistic integrity &#8211; or to highlight their blatant violence, misogyny, or sexism.</p>\n<p>The politics of hip hop education are complex. Students are assigned <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut\">Vonnegut</a> for summer reading, complete with multiple uses of the word &#8220;fuck&#8221; and a voyeuristic sexual scene that makes many adults uncomfortable, but we allow this, and in fact require it, because Vonnegut is white. He&#8217;s been accepted into the literary canon, and thus, his writing is considered &#8220;high art.&#8221; Hip hop is still the subject of intense, misdirected hatred and discrimination in schools. We aren&#8217;t protecting students from vulgarity when we forbid hip hop in the classroom. We are protecting ourselves from our fears about race &#8211; while simultaneously robbing our students of authentic opportunities to think critically about the media they consume. Literacy in the 21st century means bringing all different kinds of &#8220;text&#8221; into the classroom &#8211; especially hip hop.<a href=\"https://bemoons.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/img_1842.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-192\" src=\"https://bemoons.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/img_1842.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"IMG_1842\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p>Before I assigned the second writing prompt, we did some close-listening to several songs on <em>TPAB, </em>specifically looking for Kendrick&#8217;s commentary on the kinds of oppression we learned about while reading <em>The Bluest Eye.</em> The levels of oppression that we focused on most were &#8220;internalized.&#8221; and &#8220;institutional&#8221; (there&#8217;s actually a <em>TPAB</em> track entitled <a href=\"http://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-institutionalized-lyrics\">&#8220;Institutionalized&#8221;</a>).</p>\n<p>The song with the most visible connections to Morrison&#8217;s novel is the track previously mentioned, titled, <a href=\"http://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-complexion-a-zulu-love-lyrics\">&#8220;Complexion (A Zulu Love),&#8221;</a> where female MC Rapsody confesses that like Pecola, she was,&#8221;12 years of age, thinkin’ [her] shade too dark&#8221; and asks the listener, &#8220;when did you stop loving the color of your skin, color of your eyes?&#8221; In some ways, she&#8217;s speaking directly to the Pecola Breedloves of 2015, the butterflies who have been pimped into hating themselves.</p>\n<p>Rhapsody goes on to declare, like Kendrick, &#8220;I love myself,&#8221; and encourages young black women to, &#8220;keep your head up,&#8221; because, &#8220;light don’t mean you smart, bein’ dark don’t make you stupid.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Students pointed out that &#8220;Complexion&#8221; is about loving your skin tone, which reminded them of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWyI77Yh1Gg\">a video we watched in the beginning of the unit</a> where young woman talked about bleaching her skin to appear more white. Students asked questions about the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu_people\">Zulus</a> and became fascinated with the Zulu resistance to British colonialism, highlighting the counter-narrative that this song offers in response to institutional oppression.</p>\n<p>When students listened to <a href=\"http://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-king-kunta-lyrics\">&#8220;King Kunta,&#8221;</a> I showed them <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMPFQo5V-lA\">a clip from <em>Roots</em></a>, where 18th century slave, Kunta Kinte, who became a symbol for, &#8220;the struggle of all ethnic groups to preserve their cultural heritage,&#8221; refuses to adopt the white name of &#8220;Toby&#8221; &#8211; assigned by his white slave-master. I asked students, &#8220;why do you think he&#8217;s refusing to take the new name?&#8221; One student explained that, &#8220;Kunta&#8221; represents his identity &#8211; his African identity &#8211; it&#8217;s like what makes him who he is &#8211; and to give that up, is to give up his identity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After we listened to the track titled, <a href=\"http://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-institutionalized-lyrics\">&#8220;Institutionalized,&#8221;</a> one of my students pointed out that her skin was like &#8220;an institution&#8221; keeping her trapped in a predetermined future, much like a correctional facility, hospital, or ghetto. She pointed to textual evidence in the song that suggests Kendrick is really talking about Compton, his hometown, as an institution, that keeps people trapped inside it, even after they&#8217;ve left. This led to a discussion about poverty as an institutional construct, rather than just a personal responsibility.</p>\n<p>The last song we analyzed was <a href=\"http://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-u-lyrics\">&#8220;u.&#8221;</a> Students noticed that Kendrick, or the speaker, seems to be talking to himself in the mirror, or at least to his inner demons, contemplating suicide. I asked them how Kendrick&#8217;s demons are similar and different to Pecola Breedlove&#8217;s demons. We considered the references to mental illness, stress, suicide, anxiety, and <a href=\"http://www.ptsd.va.gov/\">PTSD</a> that surface throughout the album. These same kinds of deep, visceral responses to trauma can be seen in Morrison&#8217;s novel, as well.</p>\n<p>My students are working on their essays now, pulling evidence from multiple sources, doing research, and looking at the relationship between two classic pieces of literature. One over 40 years old &#8211; and the other just 2 weeks young. Perhaps <em>The Bluest Eye</em> is like a parent to <em>TPAB &#8211; </em>Morrison ,a living moral ancestor to Kendrick. Educators can learn a lot from this album and its relationship to the young people in our classrooms.</p>\n",

			"content": "<p>Last month reports swept through the global media that ISIS had used bulldozers to level the ancient city of Hatra. ISIS has already destroyed a <a title=\"Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 2: The Sculptures from Hatra\" href=\"https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/03/03/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-2-the-sculptures-from-hatra/\">number of irreplaceable sculptures from Hatra </a>in the Mosul Museum, lending immediate credibility to reports from <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hyry8mgXiTk\" target=\"_blank\">Iraqi antiquities officials</a> that ISIS fighters had destroyed Hatra itself as well.</p>\n<p>However, no videos or other confirmation surfaced for a month afterwards and there was no way to assess the extent of the damage. The story gradually faded from the media. Given the massive size of Hatra, and its location in the middle of the desert, in a region of no strategic significance, over fifty kilometers from inhabited areas, some grew skeptical that ISIS had mounted a major operation to demolish Hatra.</p>\n<p>On Saturday video surfaced on YouTube and other websites which showed ISIS fighters destroying sculptures at Hatra. The voice-overs from several ISIS fighters contained the standard spiel about <em>shirk</em>, idolatry, and Muhammad destroying the idols of the Kaaba. The video was quickly removed, but I took some screenshots that will suffice illustrate the items which have been destroyed while leaving out the majority propaganda elements.</p>\n<p>The good news is that the damage to Hatra is not as extensive was was first feared. The bad news is that more irreplaceable and unique Hatrene art has been damaged, threatening to further erase an already under-studied field.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the video there is an aerial shot of the ruins of Hatra which seems to have been shot from a blimp or drone. A graphic then highlights the Great Iwans and the Temple of the Triad with a label which reads &#8220;idols and statues.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gatesofnineveh.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/036.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2519\" src=\"https://gatesofnineveh.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/036.jpg?w=480&#038;h=246\" alt=\"036\"   /></a>All of the artifacts shown being destroyed in the video are from the Great Iwans.

The largest temple is a collection of massive arched rooms known as the Great Iwans, built in a Parthian style (other temples at the site are built in Hellenistic style, again showing Hatra&#8217;s importance as a fusion of East with West).</p>\n<p>Two statues situated in an alcove closer to the ground are shown being attacked. First they chip away the reconstructed base of the statues with pickaxes, then smash the statues themselves with a large boulder.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gatesofnineveh.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/318.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2524\" src=\"https://gatesofnineveh.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/318.jpg?w=480&#038;h=263\" alt=\"318\"   /></a> <a href=\"https://gatesofnineveh.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/404.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2525\" src=\"https://gatesofnineveh.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/404.jpg?w=480&#038;h=264\" alt=\"404\"   /></a> <a href=\"https://gatesofnineveh.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/611.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2526\" src=\"https://gatesofnineveh.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/611.jpg?w=480&#038;h=264\" alt=\"611\"   /></a> <a href=\"https://gatesofnineveh.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/619.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2527\" src=\"https://gatesofnineveh.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/619.jpg?w=480&#038;h=264\" alt=\"619\"   /></a>It is important to note that these statues are not reconstructions, but originals uncovered during excavations at Hatra and partially reconstructed at their bases.

No major structural damage is depicted and the destroyed sculptures seem to be clustered around Iwans no. 12 and 4.</p>\n<p>This would be a good time to note that these videos are highly produced and edited for propaganda purposes. It is entirely possible that other artifacts were destroyed which were not shown in the video. Their destruction may have been omitted for any number of reasons. The shots may have been blurry or from a bad angle. The footage may not have fit the pacing of the final production, which aims to show artifacts being smashed in seconds. If it took minutes to destroy a piece that could be a reason for editing it out.</p>\n<p>It should also be noted that firing automatic firearms while standing inside a space enclosed on three sides by heavy stone walls is an incredibly stupid thing to do. Deadly ricochets would also not make for good propaganda filming. An ISIS fighter smashing his foot with a sledgehammer would also be cut out. We have no way of knowing what didn&#8217;t make it into the footage, only that the presentation is by its very nature selective.</p>\n<p>Back in 2006, Al-Qaida in Iraq leader Abu Musab Zarqawi released a propaganda video of himself striding around the desert and firing a capture American M249 machine gun. The next month American troops raided a safe house and captured a laptop with the original unedited footage on its hard drive. American officers gave a press conference where <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;ehttp://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/05/04/iraq.al.zarqawi/vm=bv.89947451,d.b2w\" target=\"_blank\">they mocked Zarqawi while presenting the original video</a>, which showed him struggling to aim the heavy weapon and unable to figure out how to clear a routine jam until others are forced to step into the frame to assist him. Their purpose in doing so was to undermine Zarqawi&#8217;s propaganda and the cult of personality and fear he built up around himself, and it worked. A similar find, if it exists, could counteract some of the propaganda value of ISIS&#8217; videos of antiquities destruction.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is a legitimate concern raised with increasing frequency about whether any publicity at all only helps ISIS achieve their propaganda goals. However, ISIS&#8217; goals are not only to produce internet propaganda for consumption in the West, although that is a part of it. Most of ISIS&#8217; acts of destruction have targeted Shia and Sufi religious sites, <a title=\"Iraq Heritage Crisis News\" href=\"https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/iraq-heritage-crisis-news/\" target=\"_blank\">as has been extensively documented on this blog</a>. Most of this has received little media coverage outside of the Middle East, yet they do it anyways. This seems to indicate that ISIS is not only acting to create media coverage but to erase the physical evidence of ideas and history whose existence stands in opposition to their own ideology. Documenting what was lost, while being careful not to endanger what survives, is the best way at our disposal to preserve the memory of what is being lost. Once something goes on the internet, it is never gone forever.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p>[1] Fu’ad Safar and Ali Muhammad Mustafa, <em>Hatra: The City of the Sun God </em>[Arabic title al-Ḥaḍr, madīnat al-shams] (Baghdad: Wizarat al-Iʻlām, Mudīrīyat al-Athār al-ʻĀmmah, 1974), 95, pl. 54.</p>\n<p>[2] Safar and Mustafa, <em>Hatra: The City of the Sun God, </em>90-91, pl. 45-46.</p>\n<p>[3]</p>\n<p>[4] Michael Sommer, <em>Hatra: Geschichte und Kultur einer Karawanenstadt im römisch-parthischen Mesopotamien</em> (Mainz: Zabern, 2003), 71, fig. 99.</p>\n<p>[5] Location identified by comparison to other parts of the video.</p>\n<p>[6] Safar and Mustafa, <em>Hatra: The City of the Sun God, </em>119.</p>\n<p>[7] Klaas Dijkstra, &#8220;Does Gorgo Harm Us?: About the Interpretation of H106,&#8221; 171-183 in <em>Hatra: Politics, Culture and Religion between Parthia and Rome, </em>ed. by Lucinda Dirven (Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, 2013).</p>\n<p>[8] Sommer, <em>Hatra: Geschichte und Kultur einer Karawanenstadt im römisch-parthischen Mesopotamien</em>, 71, fig. 98.</p>\n<p>[9] The eagle from the Mosul Museum was published in Safar and Mustafa, <em>Hatra: The City of the Sun God, </em>143, pl. 133.

			"content": "<p>This could just be a story about countries deemed dangerous for women to travel to. But it’s more than that. This is a story about our perception of danger and how we’re told time and time again that the unfamiliar and the foreign are more dangerous to us than what is on our own doorstep.</p>\n<p>A couple of months back, British tabloid the Daily Mail ran a story in their travel section titled ‘<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-2960567/Most-dangerous-holiday-destinations-women.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sex attacks, muggings, and harassment: World’s most dangerous holiday destinations for women (and some of them may surprise you)</a>’. The top ten list declared India; Brazil; Turkey; Thailand; Egypt; Colombia; South Africa; Morocco; Mexico; and Kenya to be the most dangerous countries for female travellers.</p>\n<p>We’ll get back to that shortly.  First I want to tell you about a strange encounter I had in Medellin, Colombia in 2001.</p>\n<p>After a hard couple of days travelling, I was lounging around at the backpacker hostel for the afternoon when the film ‘<em>A Cry in the Dark</em>’ about the famous Australian dingo-baby-stealing case came on the television (you know, the one with Meryl Streep doing <em>that</em> Australian accent). With nothing else planned, I sat down with the hostel staff to watch it. As the film credits rolled at the end, one of the hostel staff shook their head and quite seriously announced they would never visit Australia. ‘Dingoes steal babies! The police are bad and try to pin crimes on you! And you go to jail!’</p>\n<p>So sitting in Medellin, once known as the most violent city on earth, and still tainted with an insalubrious reputation for gang crime during 2001, a local was telling me they would be too scared to holiday in the land of kangaroos and beach barbeques. It was pretty funny.</p>\n<p>More seriously though, this is the type of knee-jerk reaction which the Daily Mail attempts to feed on when it splashes a story about female travel safety across its pages. They’re playing on our basic instinct of safety in familiarity and the fear of what is foreign. Note the countries they chose for the list. There’s not a so-called ‘western’ country among them. They’re all in the developing world: Africa, Asia and Latin America. There’s nothing surprising about the list – despite the article title saying so – because it’s the same tired naming and shaming that has been done copious times before to these countries by the travel media.</p>\n<p>Despite not considering myself particularly brave, I’ve travelled extensively through nine of the countries above (just South Africa to go) and lived in both Egypt and Turkey for several years. I’d be the first to admit that travelling as a woman is not a walk in the park. It can be frustrating, angering and simply fucking exhausting at certain times. But how are the Daily Mail qualifying the countries above as the world’s most dangerous destinations for women travellers?</p>\n<p>If you read the article you’ll see that each country on the list gets a short paragraph of scary statistics on dangers in country. Number one on the list is India which the Daily Mail qualifies for its winning position by stating that ‘<em>gang rapes of local women and tourists have reached worrying levels in parts of the country with reports suggesting that a sexual assault is reported every twenty minutes</em>.’</p>\n<p>I don’t want to downplay India’s dismal statistics on sexual harassment and rape. Anyone who has seen Leslee Udwin’s documentary ‘India’s Daughter’ about the gang rape and murder of Jyoti Singh knows that India has a long path to walk in changing ingrained male attitudes towards women. But I wondered how some other countries, which definitely didn’t make the Daily Mail’s list, would fare if I gave them the same treatment.</p>\n<p>So using the Daily Mail’s style this is what happens when we apply it to Great Britain:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Millions of female tourists holiday in Great Britain every year but rapes and sexual assaults of women in the country are at a sky-high level with an October 2014 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-29642455\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> issued by the Office of National Statistics stating that 22,106 incidences of rape had been reported to police that year by June. An official <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/10/sex-crimes-analysis-england-wales\" target=\"_blank\">crime analysis</a> estimates that one in five women over the age of 16 has been a victim of sexual assault in England and Wales.</p>\n<p>Drink-spiking with date-rape drugs ketamine, Rohypnol and GHB has become a serious issue at clubs and bars in recent years with a 2014 <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11317161/Drink-spiking-You-need-to-know-about-Britains-hidden-epidemic.html\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> suggesting that one in ten Brits may have been the victim of drink-spiking. Women visiting the capital London should be particularly vigilant about their personal safety, especially while taking transport home at night. Using <a href=\"http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/life/index.php?fid=12&amp;page=2\" target=\"_blank\">unlicensed minicabs</a> is particularly dangerous; more than 10 sexual assaults are reported every month in the capital.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And now let’s apply the same treatment to the USA.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Street harassment for women continues to be a serious problem for women in the USA, particularly in large cities such as New York, as shown in the video &#8216;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1XGPvbWn0A\" target=\"_blank\">10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman</a>&#8216;. Rape and gender-based violence is a major issue with the latest figures from the <a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/violent-crime/rape\" target=\"_blank\">FBI’s crime report</a> stating a staggering 79,770 rapes reported in 2013 – which works out on average to one rape, every six minutes.</p>\n<p>Due to lax gun control laws, there is a high incidence of gunpoint robberies and other gun crime throughout the country. Female travellers should remain vigilant at all times, particularly if using public transport and walking at night.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And now let’s stop here for a minute and consider that whopping 79,770 rape statistic because I know my jaw dropped to the ground when I read it for the first time.</p>\n<p>Let’s make one thing clear. I’m not saying that India; Brazil; Turkey; Thailand; Egypt; Colombia; South Africa; Morocco; Mexico; and Kenya don’t have a problem with gender-based violence. I’m saying that in reality, gender-based violence is a world-wide issue, not confined to the countries above.</p>\n<p>The Daily Mail (and plenty of other media outlets) are simply using people&#8217;s fear of the unknown when they select which countries make their grade of ‘most dangerous’ for women travellers. Otherwise why would a country like Spain &#8211; where in the popular package tourist resort of Magaluf a series of highly publicised gang-rapes and sexual assaults on tourists have taken place in recent years – not make the list? Because Spain is European and familiar, and just like us.</p>\n<p>Over the past 20 years of my travelling life I’ve been called by various people brave, bonkers, fearless, idiotic and stupidly reckless just because of the places I’ve chosen to travel to. Yet, gender-based violence and harassment is as much a problem for women in the western world from Melbourne to Madrid and London to Los Angeles. So should we all just cower at home instead? Fuck that.</p>\n<p>Travelling as a female is always going to have certain extra risk factors that male travellers simply don’t need to contend with or worry about but you know what, they’re the same risks and dangers women face everywhere simply by stepping out of their house. So, spare us the scaremongering. The question female travellers should be asking is not ‘which countries should I avoid to be safe’, but instead ‘why the fuck in 2015 am I still more likely than a man to be a victim of violence anywhere’.</p>\n",

Given the hierarchy in our department, one male coworker and I were the natural ones to consider for the job. When the topic came up, that&#8217;s what he said to me: &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to apply for the job because I want you to get it.&#8221; I don&#8217;t remember what I said in the moment, but I remember quietly seething and thinking, &#8220;Don&#8217;t do me any favors. Go ahead and apply and I&#8217;ll still get it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I have no doubt that this man was well-intentioned and thought he was being supportive. I&#8217;m sure many people would hear that and not see anything remotely wrong with what was said. He probably could have expressed the same sentiment in a different way that wouldn&#8217;t have set me off. For instance, &#8220;I think you&#8217;re the best person for the job, so I&#8217;m not going to apply.&#8221; But that particular phrasing carried problematic undertones. It said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be chivalrous and get out of the way so you can advance&#8221; and &#8220;You won&#8217;t get this job unless I bow out, so I&#8217;m doing you a favor.&#8221; I had a very hard time imagining him ever saying that to a man.</p>\n<p>You could say there was ultimately no harm done because fortunately in that particular situation I could brush that off and was confident that I was a better candidate and would get the job. But I&#8217;ve seen so many women who, after years of social conditioning, constantly question their leadership. If a woman heard that message from her colleague and then got the job, would it contribute to the kind of imposter syndrome that many women already struggle with? Would she worry that she wasn&#8217;t really qualified and only got the job because her male colleague stepped aside?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s this kind of subtle undermining that can be so difficult to pinpoint, and yet can have a huge impact on women&#8217;s careers and the quality of their work lives. For people who haven&#8217;t thought much about this kind of subtle sexism, the recent Ellen Pao discrimination lawsuit put it on display. Annie Lowrey wrote a <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/03/ellen-pao-and-the-sexism-you-cant-quite-prove.html\" target=\"_blank\">fantastic piece</a> on the lawsuit and the problem with &#8220;the sexism you can&#8217;t quite prove&#8221;:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The trial dredged up dozens of messy incidents that could be interpreted as sexist, or not. Pao’s attorneys argued that they were indicative of a discriminatory corporate culture, one that punished women for their ambition rather than promoting them for it. Kleiner Perkins argued that Pao just did not make the cut. She failed because she &#8220;lacked the ability to lead others, build consensus, and be a team player.” Ultimately, the jury sided with Kleiner Perkins. Pao did not prove her case, and she lost on all counts.</p>\n<p>But reading through the trial testimony and court documents, it is impossible not to see a crummy culture, if not an overtly sexist one. And the problem is that sexism today very often is not overt. It’s subtle, and that makes it all the more difficult to identify and root out. It’s not your boss hitting on you and then demoting you to secretary when you spurn his advances. It’s your boss describing your assertiveness as too assertive, and suggesting you might be better suited for an operational role. It’s not your being asked to fix the coffees at a client meeting. It’s Cocktail Party Guy forcing you to return the conversation to business, so you have an opportunity to develop him as a source rather than talking about dogs for 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>It is pervasive. It is persistent. And it is so, so exhausting, all those subtle hints that you are a little different and that your behavior is being interpreted a little differently. On top of that, it does have profound consequences, if made through a million tiny cuts.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s sad but hardly surprising that a randomly assembled group of jurors would not come to a consensus on interpreting this kind of subtle behavior. One can only hope that the conversation around this case has made people more aware of the perniciousness of subtle sexism. I&#8217;ve certainly seen my share of it, and I&#8217;m sure just about any woman I asked could come up with examples from her own career. Cate Burlington <a href=\"http://the-toast.net/2015/04/01/things-male-tech-colleagues-have-actually-said-annotated/#wUOMMZxBm0bcLizO.99\" target=\"_blank\">put together a list</a> of &#8220;things my male tech colleagues have actually said to me&#8221;:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“You know about making coffee, right?” </strong>You have doubtless intuited this from the fact that I am the only person in the entire department who does <em>not</em> drink coffee. This is in no way related to the fact that all the other human beings in the room are men.</p>\n<p><strong>“It doesn’t have all the features; this is the soccer mom version.”</strong> Contact with the Soccer Mom (<em>mater ludus</em>) obviously requires special equipment and anti-contaminant protocol. They are highly infectious. Do not attempt to approach a Soccer Mom unless you are a trained professional.</p>\n<p><strong>“Haha, that guy thought you were the receptionist!” </strong>Did he? My, what a hilarious turn of events.</p>\n<p><strong>“Women are going overboard with this representation in video games thing, now. Like, calm down.” </strong>You are obviously a sensitive, liberal, fair-minded guy who would never say a sexist thing in your life. You know this because the last three girls you went on OKCupid dates with nodded in a vaguely affirmative way when you said as much.</p>\n<p><strong>“Let me know when you want to do that so I can help you. No offense, but you just don’t know enough about it to try it on your own.”</strong> What could possibly be offensive about your assertion that I am incapable of implementing some of the basic skills of our profession without your supervision?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Revealing this pattern of behavior and holding people accountable inevitably makes some men uncomfortable. They complain that they can&#8217;t say or do anything without making a mistake. But it&#8217;s not that hard. Listen to women who are telling these stories and believe them when they tell you it is demeaning and undermines them professionally and personally. If you find yourself inclined to defend some comment, think about whether you would say the same thing to a man. It&#8217;s not a foolproof test, but chances are that if you wouldn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s probably sexist. And you will make mistakes; we all do. Rather than getting defensive, learn from your mistake and don&#8217;t do it again.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

			"content": "<p>I&#8217;ve had quite a few inquiries about my images and posts over the past few months, and I thought it would be a nice idea to post some of my set ups for you guys to see. There aren&#8217;t really &#8216;secrets&#8217; to good food photography, but in the beginning I felt there was some kind of hidden information I needed to advance my skills. I kept hitting a metaphorical brick wall with my photography, and I just couldn&#8217;t seem to mimic those food photos I aspired to. I kept reading articles with titles like &#8220;secrets of food photography&#8221; and &#8220;all you need to know, blog food photography&#8221;. But the &#8216;secret&#8217; is&#8230; there&#8217;s no secret. The three keys to producing enticing looking food photos are: a tripod, the right light, and some version of Photoshop for minor edits. With these three things you can succeed at the very least as a beginner.</p>\n<p>The<strong> light.</strong> My favorite two things to play with these days are <strong>lighting</strong> and plateware. Lighting is the most important of these two, without good light you have <em>nata</em>. Natural light is my favorite to work with and it&#8217;s always your best option. This light is what you&#8217;re seeing with the naked eye most regularly, and it&#8217;s what will give your images the most realistic, natural quality. You can use it to create moderate to deep shadowing, or bounce it with reflectors to lighten up the frame. It&#8217;s versatile. Different times of day produce different shades and colors of light, something that is fun to play with. The only thing to note is that you never want to shoot your subject in direct light. Whether it&#8217;s natural sunlight or studio bulbs: <em>always diffuse the light. </em>White sheets, umbrellas, and photography diffusers will all help. I&#8217;ve recently aquired a small studio lighting setup with a light box, and I use this style of lighting when I need to shoot at night, but especially for product photography, which I&#8217;ll get more into later.</p>\n<p>The <strong>tripod</strong>. A most necessary staple. You may think you&#8217;re holding that camera steady but trust me, you are not. The sharpness of an image depends on many factors but the first one is obviously camera shake. To get the absolute most out of your camera and lens of choice: <em>always </em>use a tripod. Not only does this remove any risk of camera shake blur, but it also allows you the opportunity to shoot your image with free hands for styling and the like. While my camera is shooting away on it&#8217;s tripod I&#8217;m usually holding up one of three other items: an additional light source with diffuser, a diffuser only, or a light reflector of some kind. Being able to shoot hands free gives affords you the opportunity to improve your image in other ways.</p>\n<p><strong>Photoshop</strong>. I don&#8217;t know what I did before I had it, I actually can&#8217;t remember what it was like&#8230; but I can tell you it&#8217;s changed my photography drastically. I&#8217;d say I only know about 20% of what PS is capable of, but even with that 20% you can really create effects that will wow your audience. My Photoshop automatic edits include noise removal, color adjustments, <em>curves</em> for exposure adjustment, spot/blemish removal, and sharpening. These edits have a major impact on your images. Being able to &#8216;clean up&#8217; your photos can set them apart from the average snapshot.</p>\n<p>***If you can&#8217;t afford PS or don&#8217;t know anyone who can allow you to use theirs, look for free editing software such as Gimp or Google&#8217;s own Picasa, or cheaper editing options such as Photoshop Elements, and Corel Paintshop Pro (both under the $100 mark). I&#8217;ve tried all four. My recommendation is PS Elements.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The look of natural light vs. studio lighting: </strong></em></p>\n<p>The first thing to know if you&#8217;re going to attempt artificial lighting is how to <em>get the right bulbs! </em>A quick google search will yield you tons of information, but look for mid-wattage bulbs with a K (kelvin rating) in the 5000&#8217;s that states &#8216;daylight&#8217; on it. They&#8217;re usually a bit pricey, but if you get the good ones they&#8217;ll guarantee you several thousand hours of usage. A good investment. Consider the wattage of the bulb with your diffusing method of choice. A low wattage bulb diffused through an umbrella for example will be less powerful and requires your light source to be a bit closer to the subject. My bulbs are <em>fluorescent daylight</em> and range between 25-28W, and 5200-5500K. Both of these bulbs are diffused through thin, sheer fabric, and are placed quite close to the subject. Moving your diffuser from close to the bulb to further away from the bulb also has an effect on the shadows and light cast on your subject. Play with this a lot!</p>\n<p>Natural light as stated above, can be left as is or reflected and controlled a bit. Most of my recent images are shot in aerial view, and for this I prefer to have light coming from one direction with only a slight reflector bounce coming from the opposite direction to uplift the shadows. Even leaving this shadowed area heavily darkened looks quite nice, again, the way your naked eye sees it usually is pleasing in photos so long as enough detail is still showcased. Reflectors come in different colors and sizes, but the best option is the multi-use version I was gifted, which is a 5-in-1 contraption. It has a black reflector for darkening shadows, both white, silver and gold reflector for cool and warm shadow lifting, and a light diffuser. They aren&#8217;t pricey and are absolutely worth sourcing out.</p>\n<p>Once you have these three things sorted out: your tripod, some experience playing with lighting, and some form of editing software &#8211; the doors can really open up for you. Start playing with props, different angles to shoot your food from, and even the creative plating of the food itself.. and you&#8217;re onto something exciting.</p>\n<p>Some example set ups from my recent posts &#8211;  <em>(header image courtesy of <a href=\"http://deathtothestockphoto.com/\">Death to the Stock Photo</a>, check them out for free lifestyle stock images monthly!)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Image:</strong>  slice of cake</p>\n<p><strong>Light Source: </strong>natural light, cloudy day, from one direction.
